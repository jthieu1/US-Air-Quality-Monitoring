# US-Air-Quality-Monitoring  

This project will allow the user to input a City and State in the United States and will return the average Air Quality Index for that area for the past year. The user will also have the option to see the Air Quality Index for the current day. The data for this project will be collected from the AirNow API (https://docs.airnowapi.org/).
